# MSE-2202-DESIGN-CODE
This code was developed by John Van Heurn, Stephan Dhanraj, Eric Paglia and Anthony Guolla for use in our final design project for MSE 2202. Using an Arduino Platform , the robot is intended to pick up a cube, find a pyramid that emits an IR signal and place the cube under the pyramid.
